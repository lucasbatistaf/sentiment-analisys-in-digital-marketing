# sentiment-analisys-in-digital-marketing
This is my final exam codes and some other files about the use of Sentiment Analysis and Machine Learning models on Digital Marketing.
I had to learn a lot of new technologies to develop this project, like: 
  Dataset and text cleaning, removal and transformation using Pandas and NLTK;
  NLTK and Spacy library tokenization, Lemmatization and Stemming techniques and concepts;
  Learning new SciKit Learn algorithms for applying Machine Learning models;
  Learning Lattent Dirilech Allocation and a topic visualization API technique and concept for topic modeling;

The project was based on the work of Bel√©m Barbosa et al., named "Defining content marketing and its influence on online user behavior: a data-driven prescriptive analytics method".

Changes were made to manipulate a portuguese based corpus, as changing the NLP library from TextBlob to NLTK and SpacY, because of TextBlob not having compatibility with Portuguese.
